Instagram clone (original plan) ran into some issues that would've taken long to fix, so I started something else.

Final Point Tallys:
-Activitys: 2 x 1pt = 2pts
-Fragment(classes?): 2 x 1pt = 2pts (3 fragments, but 2 are very similar)
-Drawables: 2 x 1 pt = 2pts (rounded button, and custom logo)
-Fragment/layout files: 7 x 1 pt = 7pts (14 total, landscape and portrait are identical)
-SQLite(1 table) 1 * 3pts = 3pts
-Singletons: 1 x 2pts = 2pts (One for database, one copied from google(ignored)
Data structure/class: 1 x 1pt = 1pt
Network Request: 1 x 3pts = 3pts (Used volley, as discussed prior)
Interfaces: 2 x 2pts = 4pts
Recycler View + components: 1 x 3 pts = 3pts
Calling other aoolication API's 1 x 2pts = 2pts (not sure if flickr counts. If not, disregard)
Layouts for both orientations: 1 x 3 pts = 3 pts (identical, but I was satisfied with it in both orientations)


Also used Picasso image handling library (hence the weird name of my application) 

Total possible points: 34
